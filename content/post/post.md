Autonomous vehicles (AV) hold the promise of moving people and goods faster and safer. Many predict we will have fully autonomous (eg. self-driving, connected, driverless, robo, etc.) vehicles within ten to fifteen years. But there are several limitations to full implementation which continue to be debated among researchers, including who will be making the driving decisions because, no matter what we do, cars are expected to crash (Goodall, 2014). Currently, the only way to have an AV on the road is with a fully licensed driver behind the wheel. This allows the AV to be driven when the conditions change to a more complex decision-making environment. The ultimate goal is for the AV is to be driverless. For this to happen AV designers have to programatically address the likelihood that an AV will have to make decisions during an inevitable collision. And for the designers this means addressing life and death ethical issues. 
	To create an algorithm that handles these ethical issues, AV designers have mainly centered around a classic ethical problem, the“trolley dilemma”(Foot, 1978; Lin, 2015; Cathcart, 2013; Bonnefon et al, 2015, Nyholm and Smids, 2016). Posed during the days of the trolley and updated since, it is a question that grapples with life and death scenarios. In the scenario a driver has two route choices: 1) kill or harm many people or 2) kill or harm only one person (Wallach and Allen, 2009). These scenarios are all no win scenarios meaning someone will always be at the very least hurt (Foot, 1978). A google search on scholarly work with the term “trolley and autonomous vehicle” returns 13,500 articles and papers, and shows that this particular treatment is of great interest and study in the field. Most people assume that this, the utilitarian approach, is a correct way for us to proceed in thinking about this dilemma (Bonnefon et al, 2016). This approach was found widely in the literature and coupled with this particular dilemma and infrequently treated as a separate discussion. This paper will review the literature that considers other ethical arguments.
